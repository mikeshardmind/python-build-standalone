# Python Standalone Builds

This project produces self-contained, highly portable, high-performance
Python distributions. These Python distributions contain a fully usable,
full-featured Python installation: most extension modules from the Python
standard library are present, and their library dependencies are either
distributed with the distribution or are statically linked.

The Python distributions are built in a manner to minimize
run-time dependencies. This includes limiting the CPU instructions
that can be used and limiting the set of shared libraries required
at run-time. The goal is for the produced distribution to work on
any system for the targeted architecture.

The builds incorporate compiler optimizations such as profile-guided
optimization (PGO), link-time optimization (LTO), and, where appropriate,
BOLT post-link binary optimization. Together, these techniques improve
runtime performance while preserving portability.

The most common method of using these distributions is with
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

To run a particular distribution using `uv`:

```
uvx --managed-python python
```

A Python version or another specifier can be included:

```
uvx --managed-python python@3.13
uvx --managed-python python@3.14+freethreaded
```
